# oddtext_project
website text adventure, small now but I have big plans

Space URL: https://oddtext.w3spaces.com

The free version of w3spaces does not allow me to connect a github, so for now, we'll have to update manually here: https://spaces.w3schools.com/space/oddtext/editor

Remember that updates to the space don't go live until the next day.

Future Steps:
1. Fix errors, as noted by beta-testers(Luke)
2. Clear up confusing game systems
3. Separate system program into a separate file than the game design file
4. Add login
5. Add Achievements
6. Add scoreboard
7. Add advertisement
8. Consider moving the site to an AWS site, instead of w3schools
