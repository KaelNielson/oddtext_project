                <h1>What is Oddtext?</h1>
                <div>Oddtext: Adventures in a Confused Word, is a text-adventure video game startup developed by a team of one developer and whatever 
                    playtesters he could find laying around. More content is being worked on as we speak. Currently, gameplay focuses on puzzle-based, 
                    escape room style adventures with a semi-dark meta humorous tone.
                </div>
                <h1>How do I play?</h1>
                <div>In a text adventure game, all gameplay revolves around text input from the user and outputs from the game. In the <i>Play</i> 
                    tab, a list of recognized commands is given, as well  as their format. Nearly every interactable object in the game will be 
                    named with an adjective and a noun. When the noun is unique, an object can be referred to in your input with just the noun. 
                    However, if, for example, there is a gold key and a silver key in the same room, you would need to use their full name to 
                    differentiate between them. Should you escape your confinement and complete the adventure[there is currently only one adventure], 
                    you will be awarded an ending. Should you be felled by an enemy, you will be awarded a game-over. Either way, gameplay will end. 
                    But fret not, you can currently restart the adventure by refreshing the page. In the future, when we create a scoring system and 
                    a progress-saving system, additional restart commands will be added.
                </div>
                <h1>Is the game free?</h1>
                <div>Yes, you will never need to pay money to play this game. In the near future, unintrusive advertisement options will be looked into,
                    in an attempt to monetize. Should you play the game and enjoy it, please consider sharing it with another to increase our clientele.
